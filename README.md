# 🚀 Zero Downtime Lambda Function Updates

This project demonstrates how to **update an AWS Lambda function with zero downtime** using **Lambda versions, aliases, API Gateway stage variables, and weighted traffic shifting**.  

With this structured approach, users experience a seamless transition while you roll out new versions of your Lambda function in production.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Deploy new Lambda versions without disrupting live traffic.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Lambda **versions** for controlled releases  
  - Lambda **aliases** for environment separation (`dev`, `test`, `prod`)  
  - API Gateway **stage variables** for dynamic routing  
  - Weighted aliasing for **gradual traffic shifting**  

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### **Step 1: Lambda Function Setup**
- Created a simple Lambda function returning:  
  ```text
  Hello V1



- Published two versions:

    Version 1 → Testing

    Version 2 → Production

- Created three aliases:

    dev → Latest version

    test → Testing version

    prod → Production version

---


### **Step 2: API Gateway Integration**


- Created a REST API with a GET method pointing to the Lambda function.

- Configured integration request with:
 
    stageVariables.lambdaAlias


- Added resource-based policy statements for all aliases via shell script.

- Deployed the API into three stages:

    dev

    test

    prod

  ---

  ### **Step 3: Stage Variables**

- Configured API Gateway stage variables:

    lambdaAlias = dev for Dev stage

    lambdaAlias = test for Test stage

    lambdaAlias = prod for Prod stage

  ---


 ### **Step 4: Weighted Traffic Shifting**

- Updated the prod alias in Lambda:

    Assigned Version 1 with 10% traffic

    Assigned Version 2 with 90% traffic

- Gradually shifted traffic from 10% → 100% until fully moved to the new version.

✅ Result: Users experienced zero downtime while new Lambda code rolled out.
